# Pacmen
## This webpage allows the user to create numerous PacMan characters and have them bounce off the walls and different speeds.
# How to Run
## To run the webpage the user will have to click "Add PacMan" for each PacMan character they want to be on the screen. "Start Game" will have the PacMan characters move across the screen randomly.
# Future Improvements
## Have the PacMan characters also be female at random amounts. Have multiple characters spawned in at once on the page.
